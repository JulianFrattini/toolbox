This repository contains a list of loosely connected tools used in the academic environment.

## Overview

The repository currently consists of the following elements:

* [src](./src/) : folder containing scripts, mostly Jupyter notebooks for demonstration purposes
* [data](./data/) : folder containing data, mostly mocked for demonstration purposes

## Tools

The following tools are currently available:

* [bibfile-overlap](./src/bibfile-overlap.ipynb) : a tool detecting overlapping identifiers and titles of references in a bibliography file (`.bib`) as typically used in scientific publications written in LaTeX.
* [search-string-construction](./src/search-string-construction.ipynb) : a tool generating a search string from a list of concepts, a matrix of synonyms, and a list of relevant search fields. The search string can be used in academic databases for a systematic search.
